Roguelike Adventure: "Boken"
===========================

Compiling
---------

**Requirements**

 1. CMake 3.3 or MSVC 2015
 2. SDL2

**Compiler Support**

In general, any c++14 standards compliant compiler should work, however, currently only the
following compilers have been tested as working (this doesn't mean other compilers won't work).

- MSVC 2015 Update 2
- GCC 5.3.1
- Clang 3.8
